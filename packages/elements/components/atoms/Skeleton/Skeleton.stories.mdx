# Skeleton

Provide a placeholder while you wait for content to load, or to visualise content that doesn't exist yet.

### Usage

- When a resource needs long time to load.
- When the component contains lots of information, such as List or Card.
- Only works when loading data for the first time.
- Could be replaced by Spin in any situation, but can provide a better user experience.
