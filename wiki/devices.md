# Devices

Elements is designed to be device agnostic, however it is impossible to naturally support every device hence the following is stipulated:

- `Tablet` refers to Apple iPad - Air, Pro, Mini and devices with similar resolutions (including Android, Linux & Windows tablets).
- `Watch` refers to Apple Watch Series 7; however watches with similar resolutions should produce a similar result - since WatchOS does not ship with a browser this will have little to no impact for most use cases.
